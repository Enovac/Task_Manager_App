# Task_Manager_App
This is one of the first object-oriented projects I worked on. It uses Java Swing for the GUI and some other standard libraries. This application helps in tracking your goals and implements a basic reward system where you can customize your home screen using the points earned. To launch this app, run the calendar launcher located in the engine folder.
